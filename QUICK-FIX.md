# Quick Fix for React Router DOM Error

## The Problem
You're getting this error because `react-router-dom` is not installed:
```
Failed to resolve import "react-router-dom" from "src/App.jsx"
```

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Install the Missing Dependency (Recommended)

**For Windows:**
```bash
cd "F:\rahul pro v1\billing-frontEnd\my-billing-app"
npm install react-router-dom
```

**For Linux/Mac:**
```bash
cd "/mnt/f/rahul pro v1/billing-frontEnd/my-billing-app"
npm install react-router-dom
```

**Or run the fix script:**
- Windows: Double-click `fix-dependencies.bat`
- Linux/Mac: Run `./fix-dependencies.sh`

### Option 2: Use Simple Version (Temporary)

If you want to see the app working immediately without installing dependencies:

1. **Rename the current App.jsx:**
   ```bash
   mv src/App.jsx src/App-full.jsx
   ```

2. **Use the simple version:**
   ```bash
   mv src/App-simple.jsx src/App.jsx
   ```

3. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will give you a working version with basic navigation (without routing).

### Option 3: Manual Package.json Update

The `package.json` has been updated to include `react-router-dom`. Just run:
```bash
npm install
```

## After Installing Dependencies

Once `react-router-dom` is installed:

1. **If you used the simple version, switch back:**
   ```bash
   mv src/App.jsx src/App-simple.jsx
   mv src/App-full.jsx src/App.jsx
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Verification

After installation, you should see:
- ✅ No import errors
- ✅ Full navigation working
- ✅ All pages accessible
- ✅ Responsive design working

## Additional Dependencies (Optional)

For enhanced functionality, you can also install:
```bash
npm install axios lucide-react
```

- `axios`: Better HTTP client for API calls
- `lucide-react`: Beautiful icons (currently using inline SVGs)

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Check that Node.js and npm are properly installed
2. Make sure you're in the correct directory
3. Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again
4. Check the browser console for any additional errors
